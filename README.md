#My very first web page

Welcome!

##Module Learnings

This webpage doesn't serve any function other than it 
was created in a module of my [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net)
course to introduce Git, GitHub and GitPod.  

I learned how to create a repository on GitHub, open that repository
locally in GitPod, create, copy, move and delete files & folders
using command line code in GitPod, how to add and remove files from
the staging area and then how to commit those changes.  I also 
learned how to push local repositories to GItHub where I can create
a live GitHub page.

The final part of the module introduced README.md files and 
HTML markdown language.  README.md files are important for 
informing others about the project, 

##Technologies

I used HTML, CCS, GitHub and GitPod to create this project.  GitPod
was also the first time I got to use command line coding.

##Course Update 27/06/2020

I have been on the course for about a month so far and I am really 
enjoying it.  I feel I have learnt a lot of the building blocks 
and feel as though I can fit them together in my head.  I am really
itching to start building a website in anger but I know I will
get the chance to do this soon in the first Milestone Project (which 
I have begun planning out).  Once I start doing a lot of these things
for myself and gain some hands on experience, I feel I will really 
start to engrain the knowledge.
